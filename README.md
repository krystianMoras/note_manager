# Note manager project

goals:
- syncing and transcribing voice_recordings
- management of working notes
- automatic tagging of entries and files
- key phrase and entity recognition for automatic linking
- semantic search over all files + hybrid search
- task recognition from entries, parsing and syncing with calendar, management and rearrangement of tasks is another project


## some assumptions

putting a file in a folder is in itself a tagging operation
each folder will have a working note and a summary note
